Put your website on autopilot by using webhooks to get rid of manual tasks and focus on what's really important for your business.

== Description ==

Put your website on autopilot by automating manual tasks to leverage your time and ressources for what's really important to your project or business.
WP Webhooks can be used in three different ways: 

**Trigger (Send Data):**
A trigger sends information from your WordPress website on a specific event (e.g. when a user logs in), to any API or external service of your choice (e.g. Zapier, Integromat, Pabbly, ...).

**Action (Receive Data):**
An action is the reversed way of the trigger. It allows you to receive data on your website from any API or external service (e.g. Zapier, Integromat, Pabbly) which then executes a specific functionality on your WordPress website (e.g. creating a user or post).

**Flows ([Pro](https://wp-webhooks.com/))**
A Flow allows you to connect both the triggers and actions together and create tasks that are executed in a consecutive order. E.g. When [a new user is created](https://wp-webhooks.com/integrations/wordpress/triggers/create_user/) (trigger), [send an email](https://wp-webhooks.com/integrations/wordpress/actions/send_email/) to the user.


To give you some practical examples, here's what you can do via our plugin: 

= Usage examples =
* Create a WordPress user as soon as a new signup happens on Teachable
* Create a WordPress post using Alexa (Voice Control)
* Use Integromat, Pabbly, Zapier, etc. to update a user and its meta values
* Create a Woocommerce order from some Airtable data
* Send data once a Gravity Form submission was received
* Send data after a user filled out a WPForms form
* Send data to intercom when a user logs into your WordPress website
* Fire your own PHP code based on incoming data
